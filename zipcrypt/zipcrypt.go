// Package zipcrypt reads and writes the entries of a zip archive that a
// password protects, alongside archive/zip, which reads and writes the
// archive itself.
//
// It reads both kinds of protection in common use: the old one of
// PKWARE's, which zip -P, Windows' Explorer and most tools make, and
// WinZip's AES, which 7-Zip and WinZip make. It writes AES alone, with a
// 256-bit key, as the old kind is weak enough to break in minutes.
//
// The names of the entries, and their sizes and times, are not
// protected, by either kind: only what they hold.

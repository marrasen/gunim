// be dragged to a place in a list longer than the view, or a picture
// dropped into a list at a place out of sight.

// Each frame a drag is held, the engine asks the scroll views around
// it to scroll, by how near the pointer is to their edges. The content
// then moves under a pointer that stands still, so the engine replays
// the pointer where it is: the node holding the drag hears it move, and
// a drag from [UI.StartDrag] lands on whatever is now under it.

// A DragHolder is a node that drags something while it holds the
// pointer, such as a list whose rows the pointer drags into order.
// While DragHeld reports true, scroll views around it scroll when the
// pointer nears their edges, and it hears the pointer move, where it

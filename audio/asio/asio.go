// Package asio plays sound through an ASIO driver, on Windows: the
// driver an audio interface's maker ships with it. The interface plays
// what the driver is given at the rate and in the buffers it is set to,
// sample for sample, past the mixing and resampling of Windows' own
// sound.
//
// The package speaks to drivers through its own definitions of the
// driver's interface, in Go. It is for 64-bit Windows; elsewhere
// [Drivers] lists none and [Open] returns [ErrUnsupported].
//
// A process plays through one driver at a time:
//
//	d, err := asio.Open(asio.Config{Name: drivers[0].Name, Rate: 44100,
//		Fill: func(frames []float32) { mix.Mix(frames) }})
//	...
//	defer d.Close()

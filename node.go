// Package gunim is an animation-first user interface framework.
//
// Three ideas hold it together.
//
// First, the engine owns a presentation tree and runs each node through
// a lifecycle of its own. Remove a dialog and it moves to [Exiting],
// animates itself out, and the engine unlinks it once it reports that
// it has finished. That makes "fade and scale the dialog away when OK
// is clicked" a three-line widget.
//
// Second, animation runs on wall-clock time. A 60 Hz laptop panel, a
// 144 Hz monitor and a frame the compositor dropped all produce the
// same motion.
//
// Third, a window draws while something moves or someone types, and
// sleeps the rest of the time, so an idle interface leaves the GPU
// alone.
//
// Each window has its own goroutine, and that goroutine is the only
// thing that touches nodes. Application code reaches it through
// [Window.Client] and hears back on [Client.Intents].

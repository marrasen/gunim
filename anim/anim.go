// Package anim animates values over time.
//
// The unit of animation is [Animated], a value that holds where it is
// now, where it is heading, and the [Motion] carrying it there. The
// package deals purely in elapsed time: you advance values with
// [Animated.Step], passing the real delta. That is what makes a 60 Hz
// display, a 144 Hz display and a dropped frame all produce the same
// motion.
//
// A widget usually owns several animated values and embeds a [Group] so
// the engine can step them in one call:
//
//	type Button struct {
//	    anim.Group
//	    hover *anim.Float
//	}
//
//	b.hover.Animate(1, anim.Snappy)

The ` + "`widget`" + ` package has the everyday nodes. ` + "`widget.Row`" + ` and ` + "`widget.Column`" + ` lay children out along a line, with the theme's gap between them. ` + "`Grow`" + ` gives one child the space the others leave. ` + "`widget.NewCard`" + ` paints a rounded panel behind its child, and ` + "`widget.NewPad`" + ` adds a margin.

Below is a card with a heading, a paragraph that wraps, a row of cards each wearing a colour of its own, and a row whose spacer pushes the two ends apart. Resize the window: the paragraph rewraps, the swatches share the width, and the row keeps its ends at the edges.`

// Package gunimtest helps test an interface built with gunim.
//
// Its windows are offscreen windows that fail the test that made them
// if, by the test's end, anything sent from a node or focused a node
// that was not in the tree. Such a call does nothing for the node, and
// what a test sees of it is a later symptom, an intent that never came
// or focus that stayed put, far from the cause. The failure names the
// call, the node's type and where the call came from.

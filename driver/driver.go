// Package driver is the seam between gunim and the operating system.
//
// Everything above this line is portable Go. Everything below it knows
// about X11, Win32 and Cocoa, and gunim takes that layer from
// Ebitengine.
//
// Ebitengine 2.10 ships a complete reimplementation of GLFW in pure Go:
// X11 with GLX and EGL on Linux and the BSDs, Win32 with WGL on
// Windows, Cocoa with NSGL on macOS, all of it reached through purego.
// Its window constructor is the real GLFW one,
//
//	CreateWindow(width, height int, title string, monitor *Monitor, share *Window)
//
// so several windows, a chosen monitor and shared GL objects are all
// already possible down there. Ebitengine confines itself to a single
// window one layer up, in internal/ui, and that is the layer gunim
// replaces.
//
// So a gunim driver is a fork of ebiten/internal/glfw with its
// identifiers exported, plus the GL calls to replay a [paint] op list.
// That turns the hardest and least interesting part of the project —
// three platforms' worth of window and context creation, in pure Go —
// from a year of work into a merge.
//
// On Linux that port speaks X11, so a Wayland desktop runs gunim
// through XWayland. For [KindPopup] windows that is the lucky outcome:
// X11 lets a client place a window at an absolute screen position,
// while Wayland keeps a popup anchored to its parent through xdg_popup.
// The API here stays expressible on both by making popups
// anchor-relative.
//
// # Pacing
//
// A window is paced by its own buffer swaps. Pure-Go GL has no vsync
// event to wait on; what it has is SwapBuffers with a swap interval of
// one, which blocks until the display takes the frame. So each window
// gets a render goroutine of its own, locked to an OS thread with
// runtime.LockOSThread because a GL context belongs to one thread. That
// goroutine replays a frame's ops, swaps, and reports on
// [Window.Presented] once the swap returns.
//
// The engine keeps one frame in flight. It draws when it has something
// to show and nothing in flight, then waits for the report before it
// draws again. An idle window has nothing in flight, so the first frame
// after a keystroke is drawn at once. Two
// windows on two monitors swap on separate threads, so each one keeps
// its own monitor's rate.

// Shared is what every window's renderer shares: the shader programs,
// and the glyph atlas as the CPU sees it.
//
// A program is compiled once, by the first render thread to need it,
// and used by all of them, which saves each new window, and every popup,
// the time it takes to compile. That is safe because the programs hold
// no state a renderer changes: everything a draw needs travels with
// its vertices, and the samplers are set once, as the programs are
// linked. Programs belong to the share group every window's context is
// in.
//
// The glyph atlas is shared as packing and pixels. Each glyph is
// rasterized once for every window, and each window's renderer copies
// the glyphs it draws into a texture of its own. Changing one texture
// from several threads at once would need fences between them; copying
// into textures of their own needs none.

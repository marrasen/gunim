// Package access describes an interface to assistive technology, such
// as screen readers: what each part of a window is, what it is called,
// what state it is in, and what can be done with it.
//
// A node that means something to a person using a screen reader
// implements [github.com/marrasen/gunim.Accessible] and returns an
// [Info]. The engine gathers them after a frame into a [Tree], with each
// node's place on screen and which one has focus, and hands the tree to
// the platform, which answers the screen reader's questions from it. A
// screen reader's requests, such as pressing a button or moving focus,
// come back to the window as a [Request].

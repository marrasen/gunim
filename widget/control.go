// Control is the part every interactive widget shares: the fields Disabled, Tooltip and KeepFocus, the springs for
// hover, press, the focus ring and fading faint, and the rules that go with them. A program sets its fields through
// the widget, as button.Disabled.

// A widget of this package embeds it, registers its own springs with the group it holds, calls follow from Layout, showTip and
// handleDisabled from Handle, and draws inside faint, with its ring through paintRing.

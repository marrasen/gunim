// Package filemanager is a file manager: a real one, which copies,
// moves, renames and trashes, built on gunim. A program opens it with
// [Serve], or with a [Hub] for more say over its windows.
//
// A window shows one file system, an [FS]: the computer's own, as
// [LocalFS] returns it, or one the program brings, such as a server's
// over SFTP. What only some file systems can do, such as a trash or
// free space, is in smaller interfaces the window looks for, and does
// without where they are missing. The program can give the sidebar's
// places and keep the favourites itself, through [Options], and both
// may be on other file systems than the window's, as with
// [AnyFSFavourites].
//
// A window copies and moves items only on its own file system. Items go
// between file systems, by a drop or a paste, only where the program
// carries them, through [Options.Transfer]; without it, such a drop is
// refused, and Paste offers only items of the window's own file system.
// A transfer runs as one of the window's operations: it shows in the
// progress panel with the window's own, the user can stop it, and it
// asks about names that clash through the window's dialog, by its
// [TransferProgress]. Through [Options.FSName] the program names each
// file system, as the window's title says first.
//
// The window and the program are two halves that speak only in values.
// The protocol files hold the vocabulary, one file per area. The app
// files are the program half, which does all the disk work. The view
// files are the window half, which [RegisterViews] registers. A [Hub]
// joins them.
//
// example/files is a program built on it:
//
//	CGO_ENABLED=0 go run ./example/files
//	go run ./example/files -dir /some/folder
